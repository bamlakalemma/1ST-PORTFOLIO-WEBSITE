    <H1> PHOTOGRAPHY </H1>
    <P> My hobby is taking Black and White pictures. I love taking pictures of moments that happen all around me.
        When I have free time, I try to learn how to take good B&amp;W pictures and how to capture moments I find in my life. I took 
        an Advanced Photography Course at EMU in my Second Semester and my pictures are now at an exhibition at the 
        Faculty of Communication and Media Studies. You can go see them today!
